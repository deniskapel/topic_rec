# Next Entity Recommendation using Spacy and LSTM

Next entity is a noun chunk extracted by Spacy. Using sequence of previous noun chunks, predict the next one.

Model contain LSTM layer and a fully connected one.

The model was trained in Colab, see [topic_rec notebook](topic_rec.ipynb) for details. In the notebook, the pipeline is described in mode details.

TODO: update to use any number of sequences to predict the next one
